1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:09,630
If you want to change the world, start by making your bed.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,150
If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,630
It will give you a small sense of pride,

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,350
and it will encourage you to do another task,

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,990
and by the end of the day, that one task completed,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,270
will have turned into many tasks completed.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,910
Making your bed will also reinforce the fact

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,950
that little things in life matter. If you can't do the little things right,

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,470
you will never do the big things right. And if by chance you have a miserable day,

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,350
you will come home to a bed that is made,

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,510
and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,830
I've been a Navy SEAL for 36 years. Every morning in basic SEAL training,

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,910
my instructors, who at the time were all Vietnam veterans, would come into my barracks room

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,910
and the first thing they would inspect was your bed.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,310
If you did it right, the corners would be square, the covers pulled tight,

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,790
the pillow centered just under the headboard

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,110
and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,150
It was a simple task,

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,390
mundane at best, but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,030
It seemed a little ridiculous at the time,

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,990
particularly in light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,910
tough battle-hardened SEALs.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,270
But the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,750
.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,910
It doesn't matter if you've ever served in uniform or not.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,390
It doesn't matter what your gender, ethnic or religious background,

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,030
your orientation or your social status.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,190
Our struggles in this world are similar,

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,830
and the lessons to overcome those struggles and move forward,

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,910
to change ourselves and the world around us will apply equally to all.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,230
If you think it's hard to change the lives of ten people,

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,390
to change their lives forever, you're wrong.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,830
I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan,

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,910
but changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,070
So what starts here can indeed change the world?

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,750
You will likely fail often. It will be painful, it will be discouraging.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,910
At times you will be tested many times.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,790
In the darkest moment of the mission, you need to be calm,

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,790
when you must be calm, when you must be composed, when you must use all your tactical skills,

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,310
your physical strength and your inner strength.

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,790
If you want to change the world,

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,350
you must be your very best in the darkest moments.

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,910
If I've learned anything in my travels around the world,

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,350
it's the power of hope, the power of one person,

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,110
a Washington, a Lincoln, King, Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan,

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,990
Malala, one person can change the world by giving people hope.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,590
Start each day with a task completed,

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,150
find someone to help you through life, respect everyone,

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,310
know that life is not fair and that you will fail often,

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,910
but if you take some risks, step up when times are toughest, face down...

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,310
lift up the downtrodden and never, ever give up.

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,190
If you do these things,

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,550
then the next generation and the generations that follow

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,750
will live in a world far better than the one we have today

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,870
and what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better.

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,270
At the end of SEAL training, there is a bell,

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,950
a brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see,

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,910
all you have to do to quit is ring the bell.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,670
Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o'clock,

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,390
ring the bell and you no longer have to do the freezing cold swims,

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,310
ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs, the obstacle course, the PT

62
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,470
and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training,

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,470
all you have to do to quit is ring the bell,

64
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,910
if you want to change the world,

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,910
don't ring

66
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:59,910
the bell
